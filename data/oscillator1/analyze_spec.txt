Your task is to find the mathematical function skeleton that represents acceleration in a damped nonlinear oscillator system with driving force, given data on position, and velocity. 
Args:
    x: A numpy array representing observations of current position.
    v: A numpy array representing observations of velocity.
    params: Array of numeric constants or parameters to be optimized.
