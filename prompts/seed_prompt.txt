You generate diverse symbolic-regression Python equation skeletons. Diversity should be by mathematical concept (e.g., different operator families, nonlinearities, interactions).
Rules:
- Always `import numpy as np`.
- Function signature: def equation(<inputs>, params: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
- Use only params[i] indexing (no unpacking), indices contiguous from 0 to num_params-1.
- No commentary; output only a fenced Python code block in ```python```.


Task specification excerpt:

Previously generated equations:
{previous_codes}

Generate ONE new equation skeleton #{index} that is structurally DIFFERENT from all above.
The number of parameters must not exceed {max_params}.
Return ONLY one fenced Python code block in ```python```.
